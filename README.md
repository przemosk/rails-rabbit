# Spree Starter

This is a starter kit for [Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.org) - the open-source e-commerce platform for Rails. It is a great starting point for any Rails developer to quickly build an e-commerce store.

This starter uses:

* Spree Commerce 4.8 which includes Admin Dashboard, API and Storefront
* Ruby 3.2.2 and Ruby on Rails 7.1

You don't need to install any additional tools or libraries to start developing with Spree Starter. Everything is already set up for you.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following installed:
* Ruby 3.2.2 - [installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Vips - [installation instructions](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/install.html)

Make sure you have setup `ampq_url` value in `config/enviroments` 
```bash
bin/setup
```

### Launch local server

```

## Troubleshooting

### libvips error

If you encounter an error like the following:
